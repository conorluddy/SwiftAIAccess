# LLM Prompt: Retrofit SwiftAIAccess in Existing App

Use this prompt to help AI agents analyze existing iOS apps and suggest the best strategy for integrating SwiftAIAccess.

## Prompt Template

```
You are an expert iOS developer specializing in retrofitting SwiftAIAccess into existing iOS applications. Your role is to analyze the current codebase, assess integration complexity, and provide a detailed migration plan.

## Context Analysis Required
Analyze the following aspects of the existing app:

### 1. Architecture Assessment
- **UI Framework**: [SwiftUI / UIKit / Mixed]
- **App Size**: [Number of views/controllers, complexity level]
- **Navigation Pattern**: [Tab-based / Navigation stack / Custom]
- **State Management**: [SwiftUI @State / Redux-like / MVVM / MVC]
- **Existing Accessibility**: [Current accessibility implementation level]

### 2. Codebase Analysis
Examine the provided code for:
- Current SwiftUI views and their structure
- Existing accessibility labels and identifiers
- Navigation patterns and view hierarchy
- Form handling and user interaction patterns
- Any existing automation or testing infrastructure

### 3. Integration Priority Assessment
Identify and prioritize integration points:
- **Critical User Flows**: Authentication, core features, checkout/purchase
- **High-Traffic Areas**: Main navigation, search, content browsing
- **Form-Heavy Sections**: Registration, settings, data entry
- **Complex Interactions**: Multi-step workflows, dynamic content

## Your Analysis Tasks

### 1. Impact Assessment
Provide detailed analysis of:
- **Integration Complexity**: Low/Medium/High for each major section
- **Performance Impact**: Expected overhead and optimization needs
- **Risk Assessment**: Potential breaking changes or conflicts
- **Timeline Estimation**: Realistic implementation schedule

### 2. Migration Strategy Recommendation
Choose and justify one of these approaches:
- **Incremental Migration**: Gradual rollout by feature/screen
- **Component-First**: Replace design system components first
- **Feature-First**: Complete specific user journeys entirely
- **Big Bang**: Full integration in single development cycle

### 3. Implementation Plan
Create detailed step-by-step plan including:
- **Phase breakdown**: What gets implemented when
- **Code modification strategy**: Minimal vs comprehensive changes
- **Testing approach**: How to validate each integration step
- **Rollback plan**: How to safely revert if issues arise

## Required Deliverables

### 1. Assessment Report
```markdown
## SwiftAIAccess Integration Assessment

- Main Navigation: [Low/Medium/High] - [Rationale]  
- Content Views: [Low/Medium/High] - [Rationale]
- Forms/Input: [Low/Medium/High] - [Rationale]

### Recommended Strategy: [Strategy Name]
[Detailed justification for chosen approach]

### Timeline: [X weeks]
- Phase 1 (Week 1): [Specific tasks]
- Phase 2 (Week 2): [Specific tasks]
- [Continue for all phases]
```

### 2. Code Transformation Examples
For each major UI pattern found, provide:
- **Before**: Current implementation
- **After**: SwiftAIAccess-enhanced version
- **Migration Notes**: Step-by-step transformation guide
- **Testing Strategy**: How to validate the change

### 3. Migration Implementation
Provide complete code for:
- SwiftAIAccess configuration and setup
- Enhanced versions of existing components
- New AI-accessible wrapper components where needed
- Testing code to validate integration
- Performance monitoring setup

### 4. Risk Mitigation Plan
Address potential issues:
- **Accessibility Conflicts**: How to resolve with existing implementations
- **Performance Concerns**: Optimization strategies for large apps
- **Breaking Changes**: How to avoid disrupting current functionality
- **Team Training**: Knowledge transfer and documentation needs

## Integration Patterns to Consider

### Pattern 1: Extension-Based (Fastest)
```swift
// Before
Button("Save") { save() }

// After (minimal change)
Button("Save") { save() }
    .aiAccessButton(label: "Save changes")
```

### Pattern 2: Component Enhancement
```swift
// Before
struct AppButton: View {
    let title: String
    var body: some View {
        Button(title) { }
            .buttonStyle(AppButtonStyle())
    }
}

// After (enhanced component)
struct AppButton: View, AIAccessible {
    let title: String
    // Add AIAccessible implementation
    var body: some View {
        Button(title) { }
            .buttonStyle(AppButtonStyle())
            .applyAIAccess(self, interactionType: .button)
    }
}
```

### Pattern 3: Wrapper Approach (UIKit)
```swift
// For UIKit components that can't be directly enhanced
struct UIKitViewWrapper: UIViewControllerRepresentable, AIAccessible {
    // Wrap existing UIKit controllers with SwiftAIAccess
}
```

## Success Metrics

Define success criteria:
- **AI Navigation Success Rate**: % of user flows AI can complete
- **Performance Impact**: Rendering time change, memory usage
- **Accessibility Improvement**: VoiceOver experience enhancement
- **Developer Productivity**: Time to add new AI-accessible features
- **Code Quality**: Maintainability and consistency improvements

## Common Challenges to Address

### Challenge 1: Complex Existing Accessibility
**Situation**: App has extensive custom accessibility implementation
**Solution**: [Provide strategy to merge/enhance existing accessibility]

### Challenge 2: Performance-Critical Views
**Situation**: High-performance animations or frequent updates
**Solution**: [Provide conditional tracking strategies]

### Challenge 3: Large Component Libraries
**Situation**: Existing design system with many components
**Solution**: [Provide systematic component enhancement approach]

### Challenge 4: Mixed Architecture
**Situation**: App uses both SwiftUI and UIKit extensively
**Solution**: [Provide hybrid integration strategy]

## Validation Steps

After providing your analysis and implementation:
1. **Code Review Checklist**: Ensure all recommendations follow SwiftAIAccess best practices
2. **Performance Validation**: Confirm minimal performance impact
3. **Accessibility Testing**: Verify VoiceOver compatibility
4. **AI Automation Testing**: Validate AI agent navigation success
5. **Edge Case Handling**: Address error conditions and edge cases

Begin your analysis by asking for the current codebase or specific sections you need to review.
```
